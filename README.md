## Current Toolset

- **Port Scanner**
  - Fast and customizable scanning with thread and timeout control
  - Takes an IP or domain as input
  - Prints out open ports, a brief description for each, and common vulnerabilities associated with those ports
  - Includes banner grabbing for all frequently used ports
- **Subdomain Enumerator**
  - Quickly finds subdomains for a given domain
  - Useful for recon and expanding your attack surface analysis
- **Banner Grabber**
  - Integrated with the port scanner
  - Fetches service banners from all frequently used ports
- **Path Enumerator (Directory Brute-Forcer)**
  - Enumerates directories/paths on web servers to find hidden or sensitive locations
- **Malware Analyser**
  - Uses the VirusTotal API to scan hash values, URLs, and files for malware analysis
- **DNS/WHOIS Lookup**
  - Retrieves DNS and WHOIS information for domains
  - Now features DNS resolver integration in the Profiler tool (new in 0.4.1 BETA)
  - Useful for reconnaissance and domain ownership checks

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bmp-43/Inspector.git
    cd Inspector
    ```

2. Make sure `config_inspector.txt` exists with values like:
    ```
    timeout=0.7
    max_threads=100
    start_port=1
    end_port=100
    ```

3. If you will use the Malware Analyser, set up your VirusTotal API key as instructed in the tool's documentation or config.

4. Run the toolkit:
    ```bash
    python3 inspector.py
    ```

    - Select the tool you want to use (Port Scanner, Subdomain Enumerator, Path Enumerator, Banner Grabber, Malware Analyser, or DNS/WHOIS Lookup).
    - Follow the prompts for each tool.
    - For the Port Scanner, enter the IP address or domain to scan.
    - For the Subdomain Enumerator, enter the domain to enumerate.
    - For the Path Enumerator, enter the target URL/domain to brute-force directories.
    - For the Malware Analyser, input the hash string, URL, or file you want to scan.
    - For DNS/WHOIS Lookup, enter the domain to retrieve DNS and WHOIS information.

## Folder Structure

The project folder structure was reorganized in 0.2.0 ALPHA for better modularity. Each core tool now resides in its own directory, making it easier to expand and maintain the toolkit.

## Planned Tools

- [✓] Banner grabber (now upgraded, grabs banners from all frequently used ports)
- [✓] Path enumerator (directory brute-forcer)
- [✓] Malware analyser (VirusTotal-powered, scans hashes, URLs, and files)
- [✓] WHOIS lookup (added in 0.4.0, improved in 0.4.1 with DNS resolver)
- Reverse DNS
- Future: Exploit suggestions based on open ports
